 schema with missing fields (bio, expertise, languages, qualification).
Logic: Implemented robust error handling for critical paths.
2. Doctor Profile Workflow
Flexible Onboarding: Doctors are no longer forced to complete their profile immediately upon login.
Edit Capability: Added an "Edit Profile" feature in the Doctor Dashboard, allowing doctors to update their information (rates, bio, etc.) at any time.
Status Management: Doctors can toggle their "Online/Offline" availability.
3. Patient Dashboard & Consultation Flow
Doctor Search: Patients can view a list of available doctors with filtering capabilities.
Consultation Session:
"Start Consultation" initiates a session and a mock video call.
Live timer tracks consultation duration.
"End Consultation" terminates the session and triggers wallet deduction.
Wallet Integration:
Auto-Creation: Wallets are automatically initialized for users if missing.
Recharge: Patients can add balance (mock payment) via the dashboard (+10m, +30m, +60m).
Balance Protection: Strict check prevents starting a consultation with less than 5 minutes of balance.
